# RHS-Pipeline-Regression
This ongoing machine learning regression project is a dummy project to apply my knowledge on AI, by comparing models and conducting hyperparameter searches that are relevant to the problem I am solving, which is to create the optimum model to estimate the maximum time taken for a plant to grow to its maximum height based on continuous variables.
<br>
This is based on a [data pipeline](https://github.com/akikoogawa7/RHS-Data-Pipeline) which I have created prior to this.

### Aim
The aim is to utilise AI to measure the rate of growth in plants and offer realtime predictive analytics on plant-growth/maturity based on its type.
<br>
This project involves comparing the model's training scores using linear regression, bayesian ridge regression and polynomial regression.
