# RHS-Pipeline-Regression
### Introduction
This ongoing machine learning regression project is a dummy project to apply my knowledge on AI, by comparing models and conducting hyperparameter searches that are relevant to the problem I am solving, which is to create the optimum model to estimate the maximum time taken for a plant to grow to its maximum height based on continuous variables.
<br>
This is based on a [data pipeline](https://github.com/akikoogawa7/RHS-Data-Pipeline) which I have collected and cleaned prior to this.

### Target
The aim is to measure which machine learning models perform best on unseen data. 
<br>
Target variable: max time to ultimate height.
<br>
Features: `'Full Sun', 'Sheltered', 'Generally pest free'`
<br>
This model helps to predict the time it takes for a plant to grow to its maximum height based on the above predictors.
<br>

### Models
- Linear regression (baseline)
- Decision tree regressor
- K nearest neighbors regressor
- Ridge regression
